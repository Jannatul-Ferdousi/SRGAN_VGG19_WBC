# A Deep Learning Approach for White Blood Cells Image Generation and Classification using SRGAN and VGG19
In this paper, we propose a deep learning approach to classify WBCs using SRGAN and VGG19. Firstly, microscopic images of WBCs are generated using the Super Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN) to obtain more precise and high-resolution images, which are then classified with a pretrained VGG19 classifier. Low-resolution (LR) images are inputted into the generator of SRGAN, and its discriminator compares the High-resolution (HR) image with LR, generating super-resolution images to minimize misclassification risks. A large dataset of 12,447 JPEG images containing four classes of WBCs (Eosinophil, Lymphocyte, Monocyte, and Neutrophil) is utilized to train and validate our proposed model.
